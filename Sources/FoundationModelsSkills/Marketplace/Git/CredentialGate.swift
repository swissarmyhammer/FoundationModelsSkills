/// source URL. The scheme and the host are compared without letter case, and
/// a port that the URL does not write is the default port of HTTPS.
///
/// libgit2 asks again only when the server refused the last credential. Thus a
/// second request means a bad token: the gate refuses it, and libgit2 stops
/// instead of a loop. Each refusal sets ``hasRefused``.
///
/// Only an HTTPS source has an origin. An SSH source uses the exec transport,
/// and a `file://` or plain `http://` source must not get a token. For such a
/// source the gate never asks the host, and it refuses each request.

/// keeps one gate for each call and lends it to the libgit2 `credentials`
