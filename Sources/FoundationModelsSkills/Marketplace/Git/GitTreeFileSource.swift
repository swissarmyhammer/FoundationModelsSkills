/// is the text of its blob, and `160000` a submodule. libgit2 gives every
/// other mode as `100644`. The source never follows a symbolic link, and it
/// never reads into a submodule.

/// ``rootPath`` is the `path:` field of the marketplace source. It is a prefix
/// on every lookup, thus the resolver sees that subfolder as the root.
///
/// Each call opens the repository and frees each libgit2 object before it
/// returns. Thus the source holds no handle, and it is `Sendable`.
